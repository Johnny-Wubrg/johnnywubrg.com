In Magic, Johnny isn't a person. It's a _way of life_. Timmies just want to play their big, scary dinosaurs. Spikes want to win by any means necessary. Us Johnnies? We crave something more. We crave the excitement of finding an interaction no one's seen before. We crave building an engine from the atoms of the universe and watching it run. We live for the moments when an opponent squints across the board and asks "what the hell is _that_ card?"

If that sounds like you, you're in the right place.

## Welcome to Johnny Wubrg

This is a blog written by a Johnny about all things synergy and card interactions. Here, we know that a combo is about more than just going infinite. Stick around, and you'll find deck techs on the most obscure strategies imaginable. You'll also find deep dives into cards mechanics and their chemistry with the game's most forgotten rules.

Whether you're a seasoned brewer looking to break that weird _Homelands_ rare or a new deckbuilder just discovering [[Sanguine Bond]] and [[Exquisite Blood]] for the first time, this is for you.

If you've ever built a deck just to see if it could work...

Or stared at a newly spoiled card as it calls out, "break me"...

Or lost the game but won the table's respect for your ingenuity...

You're home here.
